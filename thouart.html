    Where Thou Art Going?

  <p id = "content">
        I have been lost in a land unknown to them even to me. It' serene. It's a place to wonder and no worry. I can hear the life beating in this land. The warm flow of blood and the depth of each and every breath and the  serene sense of existence are indescribably beautiful. What to hurry for? Where are you going leaving the peace and tranquility? Are you feet tired? Are you thirsty, sleepy or weary. Don't rush. What is the point in it? Life goes by as any other thing in the world. As one philosopher has said, change is the constant thing of nature. There will be change, decay but there will also be life, impulsiveness, tranquility, love, drama and rest. Where are you going? Why are you thinking what you are thinking? Take a deep breath and one more and one more and one more and one more and one more. See! the worry starts to disappear? An you are yawning. Lovely! Sometimes when you are tired have a seat, maybe with a music in background start to write things you feel. Put the belt of logic loose here. Let the water gate flow and ask yourself where are you going?
