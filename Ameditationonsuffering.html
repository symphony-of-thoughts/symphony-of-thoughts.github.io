    A Meditation on Suffering
  </h1>
  <p id = "content">
    Life is a flow. Like water passes on side to another in a river channel. The cool stream of the water makes each and every moment of the flow worthwhile experiencing. Water dies up sometimes though. Don't let it be dry. In the middle of tiredness, business remember that the flow is connected with the source. A situation may not seem favorable enough to let the water flow. A path might not be sloppy enough to let water drift on the surface of it but a water finds its way. Way back to tranquility, peace and a hope full of courage. Water is cool in warm time and warm in cold time. It is the essence of life. It comes from a great source that never gets depleted. It flows. I know this time I might not realize that because of tiredness and all other things but with just a little effort I can get connected with the flow. Just by surrendering I become one with the source of the flow. It's a river that flow from place to place flourishing living being but never demands anything in return. It becomes rich by giving away. The more he gives up and surrender, the richer and wealthy he becomes. Life remains tantalizingly amazing. It flows in forms of  grace, love, kindness and wisdom but never lends itself to anybody because the self is far off from what I think as self. The flow, the life and the beauty.
