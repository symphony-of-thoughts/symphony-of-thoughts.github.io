            My name is Timothy Roy. It's hard to introduce myself because I am different than how I usually introduce myself in my day to day life. Well, a much more clear picture of my self would be this: I am a curious, passionate and compassionate person. I have devoted myself to life-long learning. I like reading books, writing and philosophizing and spend a quality time with people. You are wondering why this blog, perhaps? Well, this a window to my world so that the unique experiences of my life live through the life of my reader and hopefully positively influence them.
