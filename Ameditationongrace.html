    A Meditation on Grace
  </h1>
  <p id = "content">
    Grace is something I have never dared to define. I experienced Grace through different experiences of my life. Grace is gentle, soft and calm. Grace even speaks or acts in the midst of suffering and brings out meaning, understanding, patience and even joy. Grace is like a flowing water. It can be held, touched but experienced. Grace stops by a heart when the heart needs it and leaves when the work is done. Grace does not remain contain in anything. It comes with a smile, hard work, love, contemplation but it does not belong to them rather flow with them. Grace has colors - different ones. It disguises itself into different colors. Grace appears in a dark room with sheer brightness, dazzling to eyes - unexpected but joyous. Grace does not make anybody owed. Grace deeply sleeps in human heart. Sometimes it needs a gentle push to wake up. Grace is the essence of the universe. An appreciation for beautiful flower, a wholehearted smile, an impulsive mind are the reflection of Grace. It holds nothing but abundantly gives away. After a whole tiring day, a heart looks for grace. Grace, the supreme form of existence holds nothing and has not but freely gives away abundantly without stopping to think. Grace is in human heart. He needs to be silent to hear the gentle flow of Grace.
